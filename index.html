          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            We are happy to announce the 15th Workshop and Industry Panel on Cooperative Automated Driving and Future Mobility Systems, which has been officially accepted as part of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2026). This event will take place on 21st June 2026 in Detroit, MI, United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            This full-day workshop provides an in-depth exploration of key advancements shaping automated driving and future mobility systems. It examines the interaction between large fleets of fully automated vehicles, but also human-driven vehicles, vulnerable road users, intelligent infrastructure, and coordinating bodies. The workshop also addresses the challenges of deploying Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS), which require extensive collaboration among stakeholders, including governments, industry leaders, and researchers. The sessions feature a mix of keynote presentations, a paper session, and industry panels with experts from OEMs, suppliers, and the ICT sector, fostering interactive exchanges between academia and industry.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Different keynotes address essential topics, including Reference
            Architectures and Standardization, which lay the foundation for
            interoperability across platforms, and Intelligent Infrastructure
            and control centers, where smart infrastructure components support
            real-time vehicle and fleet operation. Distributed Intelligence and
            Software Orchestration are more advanced strategies for managing
            complex systems and are discussed to enhance autonomous
            functionality. Further areas of interest include Cooperative and
            Collective Functions for vehicle perception or planning to improve
            traffic safety and efficiency. Crucial foundations for safe and
            reliable vehicle interaction are secure V2X Communication methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another focus is on AI-driven development and AI systems, exploring
            how artificial intelligence is transforming both the development
            process and operational capabilities of intelligent transportation
            systems, such as decision-making, adaptive route planning, or
            predictive maintenance. The workshop also emphasizes strategies for
            Continuous Improvements as part of the DevOps process. In
            particular, Simulation-Based Development and Testing methods enable
            robust and Continuous Safety Assurance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside all keynotes, the workshop also features a paper session,
            offering attendees a chance to engage with in-depth technical
            insights and discuss the latest research advancements. The workshop
            is designed for researchers and industry experts looking to deepen
            their understanding of both the technical and operational challenges
            in intelligent transportation systems.
